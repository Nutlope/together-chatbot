  # General Information about Together AI

  Together AI is a platform that allows developers to build AI applications. It provides a set of tools and APIs that make it easy to create and deploy AI applications.

  We're an AI Acceleration Cloud that lets you run inference on top open source models like DeepSeek R1 for reasoning, Llama 3.3 for chat, & Flux for image generation. We also let you fine-tune these models on your own data & have a GPU Cluster product where you can get access to B200, GB200, and H100 GPUs for training or inference. We've had customers like Pika train state of the art models & run inference on them on our infrastructure – allowing them to move faster with our custom kernels and proprietary inference stack. We also helped the Washington Post & DuckDuckGo integrate AI chatbots into their websites and helped India's leading food delivery service Zomato with an AI customer support agent.

  ## Reranker

What is a reranker?
A reranker is a specialized model that improves search relevancy by reassessing and reordering a set of retrieved documents based on their relevance to a given query. It takes a query and a set of text inputs (called 'documents'), and returns a relevancy score for each document relative to the given query. This process helps filter and prioritize the most pertinent information, enhancing the quality of search results.

In Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, the reranking step sits between the initial retrieval step and the final generation phase. It acts as a quality filter, refining the selection of documents that will be used as context for language models. By ensuring that only the most relevant information is passed to the generation phase, rerankers play a crucial role in improving the accuracy of generated responses while potentially reducing processing costs.

How does Together's Rerank API work?
Together's serverless Rerank API allows you to seamlessly integrate supported rerank models into your enterprise applications. It takes in a query and a number of documents, and outputs a relevancy score and ordering index for each document. It can also filter its response to the n most relevant documents.

Together's Rerank API is also compatible with Cohere Rerank, making it easy to try out our reranker models on your existing applications.

Key features of Together's Rerank API include:

Flagship support for LlamaRank, Salesforce’s reranker model
Support for JSON and tabular data
Long 8K context per document
Low latency for fast search queries
Full compatibility with Cohere's Rerank API

# Agents

Together is a great platform for building agents due to the features we support including strong function calling, code execution, and JSON mode support. You can also use Together AI with all the popular agent frameworks like LangGraph, Crew AI, Pydantic AI, DSPY, Composio and more. You can also use different agent workflows:

## Sequential Agent Workflow
A workflow where the output of one LLM call becomes the input for the next. This sequential design allows for structured reasoning and step-by-step task completion. Chain multiple LLM calls sequentially to process complex tasks.

Use cases:
- Generating Marketing copy, then translating it into a different language.
- Writing an outline of a document, checking that the outline meets certain criteria, then writing the document based on the outline.
- Using an LLM to clean and standardize raw data, then passing the cleaned data to another LLM for insights, summaries, or visualizations.
- Generating a set of detailed questions based on a topic with one LLM, then passing those questions to another LLM to produce well-researched answers.

## Parallel Workflow
Execute multiple LLM calls in parallel and aggregate afterwards. Parallelization takes advantage of tasks that can broken up into discrete independent parts. The user's prompt is passed to multiple LLMs simultaneously. Once all the LLMs respond, their answers are all sent to a final LLM call to be aggregated for the final answer. Run multiple LLMs in parallel and aggregate their solutions.

Use cases:
- Breaking down a coding problem into subtasks, using an LLM to generate code for each subtask, and making a final LLM call to combine the results into a complete solution.
- Searching for data across multiple sources, using an LLM to identify relevant sources, and synthesizing the findings into a cohesive answer.
- Creating a tutorial by splitting each section into subtasks like writing an introduction, outlining steps, and generating examples. Worker LLMs handle each part, and the orchestrator combines them into a polished final document.
- Dividing a data analysis task into subtasks like cleaning the data, identifying trends, and generating visualizations. Each step is handled by separate worker LLMs, and the orchestrator integrates their findings into a complete analytical report.

## Conditional Workflow
Adapt to different tasks by conditionally navigating to various LLMs and tools. A workflow where user input is classified and directed to a specific task (can be a specific LLM, specific custom prompt, different tool calls etc.). This allows you to handle for many different inputs and handle them with the appropriate set of calls. Create an agent that conditionally routes tasks to specialized models.

Use cases:
- Routing easy/common questions to smaller models like Llama 3.1 8B and hard/unusual questions to more capable models like Deepseek v3 and Llama 3.3 70B to optimize cost and speed.
- Directing different types of customer service queries (general questions, refund requests, technical support) into different downstream processes, prompts, and tools.
Different LLMs or model configurations excel at different tasks (e.g., writing summaries vs. generating code). Using a router, you can automatically detect the user's intent and send the input to the best-fit model.
- Evaluating whether a request meets certain guidelines or triggers specific filters (e.g., checking if content is disallowed). Based on the classification, forward it to the appropriate next LLM call or step.
- If one model's output doesn't meet a certain confidence threshold or fails for some reason, route automatically to a fallback model.

## Iterative Workflow
Iteratively call LLMs to optimize task performance.The iterative workflow ensures task requirements are fully met through iterative refinement. An LLM performs a task, followed by a second LLM evaluating whether the result satisfies all specified criteria. If not, the process repeats with adjustments, continuing until the evaluator confirms all requirements are met. Build an agent that iteratively improves responses.

Use cases:
- Generating code that meets specific requirements, such as ensuring runtime complexity.
- Searching for information and using an evaluator to verify that the results include all the required details.
- Writing a story or article with specific tone or style requirements and using an evaluator to ensure the output matches the desired criteria, such as adhering to a particular voice or narrative structure.
- Generating structured data from unstructured input and using an evaluator to verify that the data is properly formatted, complete, and consistent.
- Creating user interface text, like tooltips or error messages, and using an evaluator to confirm the text is concise, clear, and contextually appropriate.
